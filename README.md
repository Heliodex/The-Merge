# The Merge

## What is The Merge?
The Merge is a repository where all pull requests will be accepted as soon as possible, no questions asked. There is one exception though: pull requests that modify the first four lines of README.md. Pull requests that modify README.md will be checked as to prevent the first four lines of README.md from being changed. Other than that, go ahead and do whatever you want, and if you guys actually make a working program, I applaud you.
## go ahead throw whatever you want down here
